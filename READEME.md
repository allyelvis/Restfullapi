Certainly! Let’s create a simple example of a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js. We’ll focus on the basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing a list of programming languages. In this example, we’ll use an in-memory array to store our data.

Prerequisites:
Basic knowledge of Node.js and Express.js.
Understanding of REST APIs and CRUD operations.
Node.js (version 14 LTS or higher) installed on your system.
Setting Up the Project:
Create a new directory for your project.
Inside that directory, initialize a new Node.js project using npm init.
Install the necessary dependencies: npm install express.
